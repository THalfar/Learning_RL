# Learning_RL 
This repository showcases my training in the field of reinforcement learning (RL). It is currently in the early stages. At present, I am learning to use RL with OpenAI Gymnasium environments. I am utilizing Optuna to implement Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and Stable Baselines3 for various RL algorithms.

My goal is to integrate these training scripts into a single class once I confirm that the two-phase NAS approach is viable. This integration will streamline the process and improve efficiency.

In the future, I plan to experiment with environments that better support parallelism, such as TensorFlow Agents and other interesting and parallelizable environments like Ray RLlib and Unity ML-Agents. These environments will allow me to leverage more advanced parallel processing capabilities and explore a wider range of RL applications.
